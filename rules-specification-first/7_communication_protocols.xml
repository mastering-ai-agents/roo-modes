  <overview>
    Comprehensive communication protocols for Specification-First Development that optimize
    human-AI interaction, team collaboration, and stakeholder communication through
    specification-driven approaches and context engineering techniques.
  </overview>

  <protocol_philosophy>
    Effective communication in specification-first development centers around specifications
    as the primary medium. All communication should reference, update, or clarify
    specifications rather than relying on ad-hoc explanations or assumptions.

- **Error Handling**: Error responses don't follow pattern from /specs/shared/api-contract.md

## Refinement Request
Please refine the implementation to address these issues:
- **Update API Response Format**: Use standard response wrapper from global API contract
- **Add Data Validation**: Implement all validation rules from feature data model specification
- **Fix Error Handling**: Use standard error response format and codes from API contract

## Validation Criteria
The refined implementation must:
- **API Compliance**: All responses use standard format from /specs/shared/api-contract.md
- **Data Validation**: All validation rules from data model specification are implemented
- **Error Handling**: All errors use standard format and appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Integration**: Works correctly with existing authentication and authorization

## Context Maintenance
Continue following all context from original request:
